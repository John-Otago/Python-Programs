# Q11: Last square
#
# Implement the function last_square, which takes as input a positive integer
# and returns the largest perfect square less than its argument. A perfect
# square is any integer multiplied by itself:

# Hint: If you're stuck, try writing a function that prints out the first 5
# perfect squares using a while statement: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25. Then, adapt that
# while statement to this question by changing the header.

# Q12: Overlaps
#
# An open interval is a range of numbers that does not include its end points.
# For example, (10, 15) stands for all numbers that are strictly greater than
# 10 and strictly less than 15. Two intervals overlap if they contain any
# points in common. For example (10, 15) overlaps (14, 16), but not (1, 5) or
# (15, 16). The intervals (10, 10) or (10, 9) contain no numbers, since nothing
# is both greater than and less than 10, or greater than 10 and less than 9.
# Implement the function overlaps to take four numbers as arguments,
# representing the bounds of two intervals, and return True if the intervals
# overlap and False otherwise.
